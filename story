Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching 
his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself, he shouted, 
“Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” The villagers
came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing, 
and the boy just laughed, looking at their angry faces.\n\n “Don’t cry ‘wolf’ 
when there’s no wolf, boy!”, they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed 
at them.\n\nAfter a while, he got bored and cried ‘Wolf!’ again, fooling the 
villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and 
left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf
 and cried loudly, “Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!”\n\n 
But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy didn’t
return home, the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up the hill.
The boy sat on the hill weeping. “Why didn’t you come when I called out that 
there was a wolf?” he asked angrily. “The flock is scattered now”, he said.\n\n 
An old villager approached him and said, “People won’t believe liars even when t
 hey tell the truth. We’ll look for your sheep tomorrow morning.
  Let’s go home now
